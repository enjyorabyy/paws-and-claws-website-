                    <p> The tank is 20 gallons .The tank has an Aqueon Led 20 lighting system on top .The type of fish in the tank is difficult to determine from the image. However, there are a few things to consider when choosing fish for your tank. Make sure the fish you choose are compatible with each other. Some fish are aggressive and will attack other fish. Different fish species have different water condition requirements, such as temperature and pH level.<br><br> You should choose fish that have similar requirements. The size of your tank will limit the number and type of fish you can keep. A good rule of thumb is to allow one inch of fish per gallon of water.The plants in the tank look like plastic plants. Live plants can benefit the tank by helping to improve water quality and providing oxygen for the fish. However, they can also be more difficult to care for.
